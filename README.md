# Starships of Star Wars Random Finder App
Many Star Wars fans know about the film's characters, but most of them don't know about the
starships in the movies. This app can give the fan random knowledge of the starships in the world of Star Wars.

# Motivation
I wanted an that can give fans quick knowledge of Star Wars starships with just a quick click of a button. 
The user doesn't have to worry about placing a name of starships inside of the box if they don't know the name of it.
